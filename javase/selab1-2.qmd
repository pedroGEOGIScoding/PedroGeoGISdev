Create a Maven/Gradle Java SE Project with three classes and Junit to test objects and operations. From here you should add new features: factory pattern, JSON parser and save this JSON on local storage.

### Context
- This project is the Lab#SE#01-2 (<mark>[go Lab#SE01-1](/javase/selab1-1.qmd)</mark>), you will need to have a **basic understanding of the Java programming language**, as well as some familiarity with **Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies** and building the project.
- Overall, this project will provide an opportunity for you **to learn and apply the basics of Java programming**, as well as gain experience with Maven or Gradle, JUnit, user input via the console and data-storage.
- By completing this project, you will have a starting foundation in these technologies and be able to build more complex and sophisticated Java applications in the future: `singleton`, `factory`, `maven`, `JSON`

### Goal
- The goal of this project is to **create three classes in Java** (`Person`, `Account` and `Manager`) that implement different algorithms or data structures, and to test them using JUnit.
- Now, in this version v2.0 you will store the data on local JSON and use the `factory` pattern. For that, you will need to create the `Account` `interface` and two subclasses: `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`.
- Use the `Lombok` dependency to write getters and setters.

### Tasks
The tasks involved in this project include:
- The goal of this project is to **create three classes in Java** (`Person`, `Account` and `Manager`) that implement different algorithms or data structures, test them using JUnit.
- Implementing as well two basic pattern-designs: `singleton` and `factory`.
- Creating `Account` `interface` and two subclasses: `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`.
- Writing **JUnit tests** to verify that the classes work as expected.
- Creating a `StorageManager` class or similar, Utilities package, to store the data in local JSON.
- You should attach the **JUnit Test HTML** results to documentation.
- You should control your versions with GitHub or similar.

### Optional
- As an optional task, you could also consider **allowing the user to input data via the console**, rather than using `hard-coded test data` in your **JUnit tests**. This would add dynamism and be able to **interact** with the classes.
- Add `Credit Card` class and create the **new feature** `buy Credit Card` in `AccountManager`.

## Solving discussion

### Base Classes: factory

Here is an example of how you could create a Lombok Java class for a `Person` and `Account` using the **factory pattern**:

``` java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
}
```

---

``` java
public interface Account {
    void deposit(double amount);
    void withdraw(double amount);
}

```

---

``` java

public class SavingsAccount implements Account {
    private double balance;

    public SavingsAccount(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    @Override
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        this.balance += amount;
    }

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        this.balance -= amount;
    }
}

```

---

``` java
public class CheckingAccount implements Account {
    private double balance;

    public CheckingAccount(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    @Override
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        this.balance += amount;
    }

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        this.balance -= amount;
    }
}

```

---

``` java
public class AccountManager {
    public static Account createAccount(String accountType, double balance) {
        if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase("savings")) {
            return new SavingsAccount(balance);
        } else if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase("checking")) {
            return new CheckingAccount(balance);
        }
        return null;
    }
}

```

You can then use these classes as follows:

``` java
Person john = new Person("John", "Doe");
Account savingsAccount = AccountManager.createAccount("savings", 100.00);
Account checkingAccount = AccountManager.createAccount("checking", 50.00);

```

The `AccountManager` class uses the **factory pattern** to create ``Account`` objects based on the specified accountType. This allows you to create different types of accounts **without having to specify the exact class to use**, and makes it easier to add new types of accounts in the future.

### Base Classes: local storage-JSON

Here is an example of what a Lombok-based Person class and Account class might look like in Java:

``` java
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  private String address;
}

@Data
public class Account {
  private int accountNumber;
  private double balance;
  private Person owner;
}

```

The @Data annotation is a **Lombok* annotation that automatically generates getters and setters for all non-static fields, as well as ``equals()``, ``hashCode()``, and ``toString()`` methods. This can help reduce boilerplate code and make your classes more concise and readable.

To save data to a local JSON file, you could use a JSON library like ``Jackson`` to convert the objects to JSON strings, and then write those strings to a file. Here is an example of how you might do that:


``` java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class AccountManager {
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException {
    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);
    // write the JSON string to a file
  }
}

```
How to save an object as a JSON string to a file on your local storage (in this case, c:/data/accounts.json) using Java SE:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class AccountManager {
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException, IOException {
    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);

    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("c:/data/accounts.json");
    fileWriter.write(json);
    fileWriter.close();
  }
}

```

## Step-by-step

1. Create ``interface`` Account
2. Create subclasses ``SavingsAccount`` and ``CheckingAccount`` 
3. Create ``AccountManger``
4. Check factory
5. **Parse** ``Account`` objects to *String-JSON*
6. Save ``String`` on **local .json file**
