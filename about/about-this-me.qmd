Hi, I'm **Pedro Martinez Duran** - a **Senior Petroleum Geologist &  passionate FullStack WebGIS Developer** with over 25 years of international experience in geosciences, exploration, geospatial analysis and management.

I obtained a B.Sc. in Geology at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) in 1993 studying the last two years at Burgundy University (France) and University of Aberdeen. Later I gained an M.Phil. in carbonate sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy at the University of Zaragoza, publishing several papers.

For some years, I pursued a career as an exploration mining geologist (working in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, USA, Turkey, Portugal, France, and Italy). The MBA, and the ESIC Master in Marketing and Sales brought me to several management roles for almost 8 years as managing director in three positions. Finally, this career in management was completed with the IESE PDG in 2007. In 2010 I moved back geology becoming a petroleum geologist after completing the M.Sc. in Petroleum Geoscience at Royal Holloway in 2011.

I was based on UK for 14 years as exploration petroleum geologist and seismic interpreter working at CGG. My role was focused on studies related to Reservoir Geology, Carbon Capture and H2 Storage involving seismic interpretation of 3D and 2D regional scale surveys carrying out the full structural analysis, seismic interpretation of the pre and syn-rift packages and salt basins in North and West Africa, North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, NZ, Australia as well as in several blocksâ€™ assessment in Asia, and complex unitisation oil fields process in Algeria and Tunisia.

In the last few years, I completed internal and external trainings in geographical information techniques, especially with Remote Sensing datasets using ArcGIS Pro, and Google Earth Engine coding in JavaScript coupled with SQL and Python training to tackle with complex geographical datasets to carry out any sort of analytical approaches. 

This wide-ranging international expertise has given abroad personal and working skills in any environment such as critical thinking, problem-solving, collaborative skills, strong emotional intelligence, cognitive flexibility, and decision-making focused on customer service and negotiation skills.
