## More info

This comprehensive reference provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of map projections, offering both theoretical foundations and practical applications in cartography and geographic information systems.

The book presents a systematic approach to understanding map projections, their mathematical properties, and their implementation in modern cartographic systems. It's designed for cartographers, geodesists, GIS professionals, and researchers who require an in-depth understanding of the mathematical principles behind map projections.

Key topics include:
- Mathematical foundations of map projections
- Classification of projection types and their properties
- Distortion analysis and optimization
- Computational aspects of projection transformations
- Implementation in GIS and cartographic software
- Special projections for specific applications
- Historical development of map projections
- Advanced topics in projection mathematics
- Practical examples and case studies
- Software implementation considerations
