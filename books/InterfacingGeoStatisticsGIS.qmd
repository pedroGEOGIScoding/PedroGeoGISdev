## More info

This essential reference bridges the gap between geostatistics and geographic information systems (GIS), providing a comprehensive guide to spatial prediction and risk assessment. The book offers a practical approach to applying geostatistical methods within a GIS framework, making complex spatial statistical techniques accessible to researchers and practitioners.

Designed for both beginners and experienced users, it covers fundamental concepts, advanced techniques, and real-world applications, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation and interpretation of results.

Key topics include:
- Fundamentals of geostatistics and spatial analysis
- Variogram analysis and modeling
- Kriging and other spatial prediction methods
- Uncertainty and error assessment
- Risk analysis and decision making
- Integration with GIS software
- Environmental and ecological applications
- Case studies in various fields
- Practical exercises and examples
- Emerging trends in spatial statistics
- Best practices for implementation
