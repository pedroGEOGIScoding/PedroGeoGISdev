## More info

This comprehensive volume explores the latest advances in remote sensing technologies and their applications in geomorphological research. The book provides geoscientists, geomorphologists, and environmental scientists with cutting-edge techniques for analyzing Earth's surface processes and landforms using remote sensing data.

Bridging the gap between theory and application, it covers a wide range of remote sensing platforms and sensors, from satellite imagery to LiDAR and UAV-based systems, with a focus on practical implementation and case studies.

Key topics include:
- Principles of remote sensing in geomorphology
- Digital elevation models and terrain analysis
- Multi-spectral and hyper-spectral remote sensing
- LiDAR and photogrammetric techniques
- Erosion and sediment transport monitoring
- Glacial and periglacial geomorphology
- Fluvial and coastal processes
- Tectonic geomorphology and neotectonics
- Volcanic and karst landforms
- Anthropogenic impacts on landscapes
- Climate change and landscape evolution
- Emerging technologies and future directions
