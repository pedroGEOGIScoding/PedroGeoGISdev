# Laboratory Overview

This laboratory introduces you to QGIS (Quantum GIS), a powerful open-source Geographic Information System. You will learn to navigate the interface, manage spatial data, and perform basic GIS analysis operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this laboratory, you will be able to:

- Navigate the QGIS user interface
- Load and display vector and raster data
- Use the attribute table and selection tools
- Apply symbology and create thematic maps
- Perform basic spatial queries and analysis
- Create and export map compositions

## Prerequisites

- QGIS 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of GIS concepts
- Sample datasets (provided)

# Getting Started with QGIS

## Exercise 1: QGIS Interface Exploration

### Step 1: Launch QGIS
1. Open QGIS from your applications menu
2. Familiarize yourself with the startup screen
3. Create a new project

### Step 2: Interface Components
Explore the main interface elements:

- **Menu Bar**: Access to all QGIS functions
- **Toolbars**: Quick access to common tools
- **Layers Panel**: Manages map layers
- **Map Canvas**: Displays spatial data
- **Status Bar**: Shows coordinate information

### Navigation Tools
Practice using essential navigation tools:
- Zoom in/out
- Pan
- Zoom to full extent
- Zoom to layer
- Identify features tool

# Data Loading and Management

## Exercise 2: Adding Vector Data

### Loading Shapefiles
1. Use "Layer" → "Add Layer" → "Add Vector Layer"
2. Browse and select sample shapefiles:
   - Administrative boundaries
   - Road network
   - Point locations (cities, facilities)

### Data Source Manager
1. Open the Data Source Manager (Ctrl+L)
2. Explore different data source options
3. Add data from various formats

## Exercise 3: Adding Raster Data

### Loading Raster Layers
1. Add raster data (satellite imagery, DEM)
2. Explore raster properties
3. Adjust display settings and transparency

### Coordinate Reference Systems
1. Check layer CRS information
2. Understand project CRS settings
3. Reproject layers if necessary

# Data Exploration and Visualization

## Exercise 4: Attribute Tables and Selection

### Working with Attributes
1. Open attribute tables for vector layers
2. Sort and filter data
3. Calculate new fields using the field calculator

### Selection Tools
1. Select features by clicking
2. Select by expression
3. Select by location
4. Invert and clear selections

## Exercise 5: Symbology and Styling

### Single Symbol Rendering
1. Change layer colors and symbols
2. Adjust symbol size and transparency
3. Apply different marker types

### Categorized Styling
1. Create thematic maps based on attributes
2. Use different classification methods
3. Customize color schemes

### Graduated Symbols
1. Create choropleth maps
2. Apply graduated symbol sizing
3. Adjust classification breaks

# Basic Spatial Analysis

## Exercise 6: Measurement and Basic Tools

### Measurement Tools
1. Measure distances and areas
2. Use the identify tool for feature information
3. Create measurement layers

### Basic Geoprocessing
1. Create buffers around features
2. Perform spatial joins
3. Clip layers by extent

## Exercise 7: Spatial Queries

### Query Builder
1. Build attribute queries
2. Use SQL expressions
3. Save and load queries

### Spatial Relationships
1. Select features by location
2. Understand spatial predicates
3. Combine spatial and attribute queries

# Map Composition and Output

## Exercise 8: Print Layout

### Creating a Map Layout
1. Open the Print Layout designer
2. Add a map item to the layout
3. Configure map extent and scale

### Layout Elements
1. Add title and text elements
2. Insert legend and scale bar
3. Add north arrow and grid
4. Include data source information

### Export Options
1. Export as PDF
2. Export as image (PNG, JPEG)
3. Configure export settings

# Advanced Features Preview

## Exercise 9: Plugin Exploration

### Plugin Manager
1. Access the Plugin Manager
2. Browse available plugins
3. Install useful plugins for beginners

### Processing Toolbox
1. Open the Processing Toolbox
2. Explore available algorithms
3. Run a simple processing tool
